# Data preprocessing

1. use Python to implement the logic of finding past N match results and goal scorings, and winning/losing streaks for teams.
2. use Excel pivotable to append club SPI global rankings and league Intl SPI rankings into spi matches dataset.
3. drop rows with empty scores for training data
4. one-hot encode column "league", "team1" and "team2"
5. for other columns, use SimpleImputer to fill in mean value
6. use StandardScaler for standardization
7. use train_test_split to split final dataset into training and testing data
