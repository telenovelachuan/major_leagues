prerequisites:
- define "weak team" for each league: pick teams with the lowest 25% spi to be labeled as weak teams
- define "strong team" for each league: pick teams with the highest 25% spi to be labeled as strong teams
(interestingly, I found the "strong teams" in English Premier League are:
Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea
which are exactly the "top giant 6" in Premier League today. Anyway I love watching Premier League every week...)
